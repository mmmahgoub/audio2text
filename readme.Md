# Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You need to install Flask and SpeechRecognition. You can do this using pip:


pip install Flask SpeechRecognition pyaudio


# Step 2: Run the Application
Run your Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal:

python app.py
Step 5: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Click the "Start Recording" button to start the speech recognition process.

Note
Make sure your microphone is set up correctly and is working.
The application uses Google Speech Recognition, which requires an internet connection.
You may need to adjust permissions for microphone access depending on your operating system and browser settings.
This code provides a basic implementation of speech-to-text functionality using Flask and the SpeechRecognition library. You can further enhance it by adding error handling, styling, and more features as needed.
